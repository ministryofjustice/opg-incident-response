# OPG Incident Response ⚡

OPG Incident Response is a Django app based on [Monzo's Response tool](https://github.com/monzo/response), with some additional integrations with tools we use and a reskin to meet GOV.UK design standards.

## Local Development

To start the application locally, copy `env.dev.example` to `.env` and configure the environment variables inside. All environment variables need to be set, but some can be set to nonsense values (i.e. `ENV_VAR=...`) as detailed in the table below.

You will need to configure a Slack app following the instructions below, and can then start the application with `docker-compose up -d`.

Note if you are using ngrok, they have now introduced auth tokens so you'll need to add one to the `ngrok.yml` in the ngrok container

## Versions and Releases

This project uses [SemVer for](https://semver.org) versoning.

By default, any merge to main will be a MINOR release. You can control which version number to increment by add #major, #minor or #patch to the commit message that goes into main.

### Configuring Slack

In order to avoid polluting our real Slack workspace, and to give you full control over permissions, you should configure your local copy of the app with [your own Slack workspace][slack-create].

You now need to [create a Slack app][slack-app-create] and [configure it][slack-app-config]. Note that you'll need your public ngrok URL to configure endpoints for Slack to use, which you can find by running `docker-compose logs ngrok`.

After you've configured your app, Slack will provide you with bot OAuth token (starting `xoxb-`) and a signing secret, which should be used for the `SLACK_TOKEN` and `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` environment variables, respectively. You'll also need to set `SLACK_TEAM_ID` to the team ID of your Slack workspace.

Finally, you'll need to set `INCIDENT_BOT_ID` and `INCIDENT_BOT_NAME` to your bot's ID and public name; and `INCIDENT_CHANNEL_NAME` and `INCIDENT_REPORT_CHANNEL_NAME` to the central channel that you want to report all incidents to (e.g. `opg-incident`).

If you restart ngrok, it will generate a new public URL and you'll have to reconfigure the Slack app to reference that.

### Configuring additional integrations

#### GitHub signin

GitHub signin is turned off in dev mode, but you can enable it by enabling the `RESPONSE_LOGIN_REQUIRED` setting in `dev.py`.

To connect to GitHub, you'll need to create a GitHub OAuth App and set the environment variables `SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_KEY` and `SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` to its the app's key and secret respectively. There is already an app called "opg-response-development" which is set up in the ministryofjustice organization for local development.

#### Statuspage

As with Slack, local development shouldn't interfere with our real Statuspage so you'll need to set up your own account. You should then set `STATUSPAGEIO_API_KEY` to [your API key][statuspage-api-key] and `STATUSPAGEIO_PAGE_ID` to your team ID.
